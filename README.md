# machine-learning
machine learning and deep learning algorithms implementation, from Prof. Ng's machine learning class of coursera as well as in his  deep learning tutorial website. Some interesting and popular algorithms are included, such as neural networks (in ex4 folder), convolutional neural networks (in cnn folder), unsupervised feature learning (PCA folder and RICA folder), as well as recommendation systems design.
