# machine-learning
machine learning and deep learning algorithms implementation, from Prof. Ng's machine learning class of coursera as well as in his  deep learning tutorial website. Some interesting and popular algorithms are included, such as neural networks (in ex4 folder), convolutional neural networks (in cnn folder), unsupervised feature learning (PCA folder and RICA folder), as well as recommendation systems design.
It is interesting to note that, with further carefully designed learning rate in my program, the trained CNN can achieve accuracy of as high as 98.4%, compared to the stated accuracy of 96%  in Prof. Ng's UFLDL Tutorial website.
